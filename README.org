#+title: Unnamed Game

* Idea
A Vampire Survivor's inspired game, but instead of overhead view, a 2d
platformer like view, and enemies would come from many places and the
player should try to hop onto platforms.

* Setup

This was bootstrapped following [[https://sr.ht/~benthor/absolutely-minimal-love2d-fennel/][this]] guide.

To develop, just run 
#+begin_src bash
  nix develop
#+end_src
